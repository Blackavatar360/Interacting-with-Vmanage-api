# Interacting-with-Vmanage-api-for-sdwan-sites 

The essence is of this repository is to show a few use cases in interacting with the vmanage rest api

The first use case is changing some values in the device template of a particular branch site via API. 
For example my organisation had a technical issue and could no longer access the vmanage GUI. However we had an urgent need to replace one 
the service provider links at one of the branch sites due to poor service
